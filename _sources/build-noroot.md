# üìÑ Building without root access

There are situations where root access is not given, however, do not worry,
there are 3 options to choose from:

* Use --fakeroot.
* Use proot.
* Use Singularity Container Services.

## Using fakeroot

A *fake root* user has almost the same administrative rights as root but only
inside the container and the requested namespaces.

All files or directories created by the *fake root* user are owned by root:root
inside the container, and user:group outside of the container. Let‚Äôs consider
the following example, in this case ‚Äúuser‚Äù is authorized to use the fakeroot
feature and can use 65536 UIDs starting at 131072 (same thing for GIDs).

Restrictions are also applied to networking, if singularity is executed without
the `--net` flag, the *fake root* user won‚Äôt be able to use ping or bind a
container service to a port below 1024.

The `--fakeroot` option is only available with the following commands:

* `shell`
* `exec`
* `run`
* `instance start`
* `build`

Let's build the SIF image from the previous Lab 3:

```bash
$ singularity build --fakeroot lab3-fakeroot.sif lab3.def

```

As you can see, the build is completed without having to rely on root or
administrative access. However take into consideration this feature is only
available for operating systems with linux kernel version 3.18 and newer, if
your kernel is older, then your next option is to use proot.

## Using proot

SingularityCE 3.11 introduces the ability to run some definition file builds
without --fakeroot or sudo. This is useful on systems where you cannot sudo, and
the administrator cannot perform the configurations necessary for --fakeroot
support.

Unprivileged proot builds are automatically performed when proot is available on
the system and singularity build is run by a non-root user against a definition
file, so no flags need to be passed on to the singularity command.

Installing proot is out of the scope of this tutorial. It is important to remark
that this method comes with its limitations because administrative user (root)
emulation is not complete, so let‚Äôs evaluate the definition file first and
determine if it is worth using this method.

* Do not support arch / debootstrap / yum / zypper bootstraps. Use localimage,
library, oras, or one of the docker/oci sources.
* Do not support `%pre` and `%setup` sections of definition files.
* Run the `%post` sections of a build in the container as an emulated root user.
* Run the `%test` section of a build as the non-root user, like singularity
test.
* Are subject to any restrictions imposed in singularity.conf.
* Incur a performance penalty due to the `ptrace`-based interception of
syscalls used by proot.
* May fail if the `%post` script requires privileged operations that proot
cannot emulate.

If your system have proot installed, you might get an output similar to this:

```bash
$ singularity build lolcow.sif lolcow.def
INFO:    Using proot to build unprivileged. Not all builds are supported.
If build fails, use --remote or --fakeroot.
INFO:    Starting build...
```

````{note}
SingularityCE automatically calls proot for you and performs the build. To know
if `proot` is installed, it is typically installed in a directory listed in the
$PATH environment variable, issuing `which proot` command will let you know if
it is installed.
