# Welcome to Singularity Tutorial

In recent years, container runtimes have become an indispensable tool in large
computing environments and high performance computing (HPC) labs.

The SingularityCE community designed SingularityCE containers specifically for
HPC applications. Unlike other popular options, Singularity containers work
seamlessly with existing HPC tools, including batch schedulers, job managers,
and message passing interface (MPI) capabilities.

This tutorial:

* Introduces SingularityCE and its key features and tools
* Explains how to install and run SingularityCE containers
* Provides guidance for using key features and tools
* Tutorial examples and code excerpts are written for compatibility with version
3.11 of SingularityCE or SingularityPRO.
